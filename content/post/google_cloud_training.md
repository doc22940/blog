# Google Cloud Onboarding Day

It's a one day event where anybody can attend for free in order to see what's available in the cloud build by Google.
Here is what the summary of that day.
At 8.00 sharp, the doors open to many people who were already waiting.
By waiting I mean playing with their phone, like I'm doing right now because I'm writing this blog post.
The presentation starts and it is a very well polished, very high level with technical anecdotes.
There is a webpage to ask questions and the slides were available before the presentation starts.
We received the link by email.
It is quite overwhelming the number of people that showed up.
I heard the number was >400 people but I have no means to verify that information.
Although as a guestimate it is alright.

## Why attending

To see what was available because AWS is pretty much the default for every company I've worked for.
Google has a lot of highly qualified software engineers and invested many billions $ into its cloud.
Or maybe I was just curious. So let's see what we are going to learn.

## Content

1. Introducing Google Cloud Platform
1. Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform
1. Google Compute Engine and Networking
1. Google Kubernetes Engine
1. Serverless on Google Cloud
1. Google Cloud Platform Storage Options
1. Big Data and Machine Learning

## Introduction & Getting Started

In the presentation, we see the Google infrastructure which is something I didn't suspect to be that big.
People might guess it's big but they don't how big. In short, it's massive!
Google keeps its own offline backup of the internet. Usage of that backup hasn't been disclosed.
They couldn't find anything that could support their scale from the hardware to databases, even the subsea cables are tailor-made for Google.
Google had to build everything from scratch.
That alone is an impressive fact.
The note that surprised me the most is that it's 100% carbon neutral since 2007

The GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is actually flexible enough to let the user choose how much of the infrastructure they are comfortable managing.

My notes

Google cloud day

Opening at 8.00 sharp many people are already waiting. By waiting I mean playing with their phone like me while writing this blog post.

Google has been doing orchestration for many years since the initial Borg paper. (insert link)

It keeps its own offline internet

x Big on renewable energy

Discount for sustained use

Trust nothing is the security policy

Patch google first then 6 months time bomb


The project organization in gcp can be really bureaucratic... but extremely fine grained!!!

Gcp seems really open to other cloud provider probably in order to attract more people

Using Oauth2 to authenticate every request

Lower latency using other gcp product

Start with google cloud launcher - predefined product setup but not managed

The way it handle network is the main difference because they use their own until the last moment (customer isp)

Bring your own encryption keys

Nobody knows how AI is being used at google because everything is confidential

Can import VMware seamlessly nothing to configure

Transparent about the legacy hardware in data center

Everything runs in container even the vm

Super fine tune of resources example 5 cores or 11...

Recommend when over provision

Ubuntu works best.. extensive benchmarking improved perf

Sub licence for Windows

Use the UI to get the command line to execute

Disk size is correlated to bandwidth

Autoscaler based on your own metrics (# users in game on a vm)

Preemptive machine has to go back after 24h . To game the system just create 5 every 5 min.

On different vpc it goes in the internet

Peering DB

100% sla on cloud dns

Cloud harmony website for perf

New term ubernetes: kubernetes cluster around the world that choose the closest to user.

Monzo is a bank everything is cloud native

Compute density vs resiliency

Peter svensson leader of developer group

App engine supports AB&C testing and split traffic

Google cloud in china:
3 things required by gov:
* keys to building
* Companyâ€™s encryption keys
* Customers encryption keys
